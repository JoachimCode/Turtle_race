# Turtle_race
A turtle racing game using the 'turtle' module.   
Goal was to practice coordinates and multiple objects.   
The user can bet on a turtle color and will win/lose depending on the randomized turtle race's outcome.   
I coded it in a way so that you can add additional turtles by adding a color to the 'color' list as a string.
The screen itself will not adjust to additional turtles, so if the amount of turtles are too many, the screensize or the distance between the turtles may have to be adjusted
